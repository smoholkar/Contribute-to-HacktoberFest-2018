====================================

1.To start using Flexbox first step is to create a flex container.

.flex-container {
    display: flex;
}

/* OR */

.flex-container {
    display: inline-flex;
}

2. Once container is ready different properties can be applied to it. list of properties include:

    flex-direction
    flex-wrap
    flex-flow
    justify-content
    align-items
    align-content
    order
    align-self
    flex-grow
    flex-shrink
    flex-basis
    flex
	
3. Property usage:

	1. flex-direction
	Usage:
		flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse
	Description: Specifies how flex items are positioned within container.
	
	2. flex-wrap
	Usage:
		flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse
	Description: Controls whether the flex container is single-line or multi-line, and the direction of the cross-axis, 
	which determines the direction new lines are stacked in.
	
	3.flex-flow
	Usage:
		flex-flow: <'flex-direction'> <'flex-wrap'>
	Description: is a shorthand for setting the flex-direction and flex-wrap properties, which together define the flex containerâ€™s main and cross axes.
	The initial value of the flex-flow property is the concatenation of the initial values of the flex-direction and flex-wrap properties:
		flex-flow: row nowrap;
