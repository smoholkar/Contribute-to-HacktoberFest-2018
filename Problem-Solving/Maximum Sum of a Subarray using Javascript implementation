/*The idea behind -
A) Kadane's Algo - Basically I have to look for all contiguous sub-arrays of size 4, and also keep track of the maximum sum contiguous sub-array until the end. Whenever I find a new contiguous sub-array, I check if the current sum is greater than the max_sum so far and updates it accordingly.
B) In the first loop is I am just generating the sum of the sub-array of the first 4 elements.
C) In the second loop, I am traversing a sliding window - at each iteration, I am deducting the first element from left and adding next element to the right. And after doing this, updaing the max_so_far to its highest value, by comparing it to its previous hightest value.

		curr_max += (nums[j] - nums[j - k]);
		// Each time we get a new curr_sum compare it with max_so_far and update max_so_far if it is greater than max_so_far    
		max_so_far = Math.max(curr_max, max_so_far);
